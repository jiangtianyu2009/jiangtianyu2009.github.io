WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs.  

It enables you to **stay productive** when an API you depend on **does not exist** or not complete.  

We use WireMock standalone jar as startup in this post. Download the jar file from http://wiremock.org, the last version is `2.17.0`, run the WireMock process via command `java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.17.0.jar`.  

There are several commond line options such set the port number, refer at [Running as a Standalone Process](http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/).  

----------

## WireMock Folder ##

- `__files`  
  Html, js, css, picture files.
- `mappings`  
  Json files.

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wiremock-directory.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wiremock-directory.png)  

Put a json file with below content into the `mappings` folder.  
```
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/api/mytest"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": "More content\n"
    }
}
```
And try to fetch the API via `GET`:  
`http://localhost:8080/api/mytest`

----------

## Record && Playback ##

We use the douban API to fetch online movie for test:  
`https://api.douban.com/v2/movie/in_theaters`

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wiremock-proxy.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wiremock-proxy.png)  

### Record ###

- Web Recoder  
  `http://localhost:8080/__admin/recorder`  
  Fill into the root proxy domain: `https://api.douban.com`  
  Then make a request through WireMock to the target API via `GET`:  
  `http://localhost:8080/v2/movie/in_theaters`  

- Command Line Tool
  Use command line instead of Web GUI:  
  `java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.17.0.jar --proxy-all="https://api.douban.com" --record-mappings --verbose`
  
### Playback ###

After `Record`, there will have a file with name `v2_movie_in_theaters-xxxxxx.json` in the `mappings` folder.  

Disable network and try to fetch:  
`http://localhost:8080/v2/movie/in_theaters`  

Thanks!
