## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Dell EMC (2016.07 - Now)

Storage product related work. Focused on the test platform develop, web GUI test, REST API test, test tools develop, etc.

#### Continuous Test Execution Environment

Development of CTEE system. This project is designed to increase utilization of Storage Arrays in the lab. This system can distribute a lot of testcases to more than 50 Storage Arrays, execute and collect test logs of these testcases automatically. I take the part of work on system Install & Upgrade and Data Migration, and a Chrome extension for log enhancement.
The CTEE system increased Array utilization significantly, the number of testcases executed in a build cycle increased to more than 200.

#### Development of Automation TestCases

Development of Automation TestCases. I've worked on Web GUI test and fault tolerance test, from testcase design and coding to execute and bug track. Web GUI test is based on Test Complete and Selenium automation test script. Fault tolerance test is based on mock interface of system debug command, like disk pull, power failure, reboot, PCIe error, etc.
Automation testcases will be benefit to the product quality, like we find issues at the very early of a new version on support NVMe device, and it's very helpful to the project progress.
